## Notes for Using the Python Notebook

If you have installed DaeFinder using `pip`, replace the import statement:

```python
from dae_finder import *..
```

with:

```python
from daeFinder import *..
```

unless you have cloned the repository and are running the notebook from within the repository directory.
